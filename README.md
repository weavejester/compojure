# Compojure [![Build Status](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Compojure is a small routing library for [Ring][1] that allows web
applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [compojure "1.7.1"]

## Usage

This small Compojure application demonstrates creating a Ring handler
from two routes:

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]))

(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
  (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))
```
