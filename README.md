# Compojure

Compojure is a small routing library for [Ring][1] that allows web
applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

## Usage

This small Compojure application demonstrates creating a Ring handler
from two routes:

```clojure
(ns hello-world
  (:use compojure.core)
  (:require [compojure.route :as route]))

(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
  (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))
```
